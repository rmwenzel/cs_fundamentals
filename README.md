# CS Fundamentals
---

OOP implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms in Python 3.


## Overview

This is a personal project for learning purposes. The main aims are:

- Learn data structures and algorithms through scratch implentations
- Practice object-oriented programming
- Practice good software development:
	- documentation
	- version control
	- unit testing
	- virtual environment

Development is ongoing

## Data Structures

These are found in the directory `structs`. Implemented so far are

- Linked list structures (`linkedlist.py`):
	- `SinglyLinkedList`

## Requirements 

Although there are few packages beyond the python standard library, I'm using a 
[conda virtual environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#). The file 'environment.yml' contains all conda and pip dependencies. If you have conda installed you can create the environment with

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
